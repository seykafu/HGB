# Icon Creation

You need to create three icon files:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)  
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can use any image editor or online tool to create these. The icons should represent the Paralogue NPC Copilot (maybe a cute robot or NPC character).

For now, you can use placeholder icons or generate simple colored squares as placeholders.
